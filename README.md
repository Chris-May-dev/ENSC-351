# ENSC-351
The code in this repository is a sample of what I submitted for my ENSC 351 Embedded &amp; RT System Software course

These archive files include files that I and my partner Forbes Ng worked on, these files are part of a larger
class project of simulating a transfer of data from one thread to another thread on a CPU to ultimately teach us 
how to communicate with an FPGA via a UART interface that we completed the driver for.
